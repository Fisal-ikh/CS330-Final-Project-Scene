# CS330-Final-Project-Scene

How do I approach designing software?
  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  What design process did you follow for your project work?
  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
In approaching the design of software, a systematic and iterative process is key. Understanding the problem thoroughly, defining clear objectives, and outlining the architecture are crucial initial steps. Throughout the project, skills in 3D modeling, texture mapping, lighting design, and camera control were honed, enhancing the ability to create visually appealing and interactive applications. The design process followed a structured approach, starting with a high-level design and progressively refining it based on feedback and testing. This iterative design process allowed for continuous improvement and ensured that the final product met the project requirements. These tactics can be applied in future work by emphasizing a thorough understanding of requirements, clear problem definition, and iterative development to improve the quality and effectiveness of software solutions.

How do I approach developing programs?
  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  How did iteration factor into your development?
  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Approaching program development involves understanding requirements, designing the architecture, implementing the design, and testing the software thoroughly. During the project, new development strategies were employed, such as modular programming to improve code readability and reusability. Iteration played a significant role, allowing for gradual improvements to the software by iterating on designs, implementing new features, testing them, and refining them based on feedback. Throughout the milestones, the approach to developing code evolved from basic shapes and textures to more complex features, leading to a polished final product. This evolution involved learning new techniques, refining existing code, and improving overall code quality.
